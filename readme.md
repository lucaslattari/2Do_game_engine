# 2Do Game Engine
2Do is a simple 2D game engine created with Python, Pygame and Pytmx. It's currently a work in progress and is primarily focused on creating platformer games.

## Features

* Looped backgrounds
* Loading levels and tilesets from Tiled Map Editor (unfinished)
* Animations for sprites and tilesets (unfinished)
* Basic collision detection (unfinished)
* Simple player movement (unfinished)
 
I'm creating this engine for study purposes, and I welcome suggestions for improvement!
